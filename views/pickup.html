        <p>It's encouraging to see that, according to WRAP's October 2022 Recycling Tracker report,
            89% of Pakistanis actively recycle, indicating that the practice has spread throughout the country.
            Even with this encouraging development, there is still opportunity for improvement, since over half
            of us (54%) acknowledge that we throw away things in the regular trash that we could easily recycle
            at home.</p>
        <p>In Pakistan, we have a similar situation where recycling is increasing but clearly has to be
            improved. A considerable proportion of people (54%) choose to discard recyclables in the regular
            trash can, possibly because they think that small actions have little effect. But it's important to
            understand that even little efforts count. Together, we can achieve significant changes if we all
            pledge to recycle a little bit more. What’s even better is that it doesn’t take any extra work.
            Let's investigate how we might improve Pakistan without creating more difficulties.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Why we don’t always recycle, even when we could:</h2>
                <p>There are many other reasons why we can decide to discard a recyclable item rather than recycle it,
                    so it’s not only because we think it won’t make much of a difference. To start taking action, we
                    must first be honest with ourselves—not to punish ourselves, but to recognize the causes. As an
                    example, we may consider:</p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>“I’m not sure whether it can be recycled” is a frequent feeling. To be safe, one may decide to
                        put it in the general waste bin instead of asking questions about whether something can be
                        recycled or if particular elements need to be removed before recycling.</li>
                    <li>“It’s disgusting,” a reaction that indicates we don’t want to deal with food residue, such as
                        washing out food packaging.</li>
                    <li>"It's too much hassle" -- after a hard day, we often want to settle down and unwind, but
                        cleaning or removing parts can feel like an added hassle.</li>
                    <li>"Put it in the bathroom bin" recycling isn't limited to the kitchen; without a routine, habit,
                        or special container for recycling materials outside of the kitchen, recycling efforts may be
                        neglected (such as in the bathroom).</li>
                    <p>Are any of these mental processes familiar to you? Fortunately, none of these requires
                        significantly more work to overcome. For instance, it's simple to find out if something can be
                        recycled, and once you do, you'll know for sure the following time. To recycle food residue, all
                        it takes is a fast rinse in the washing up water after you've finished washing the dishes. You
                        could also just place a bag for recycling like empty shampoo bottles on the back of your
                        bathroom door.</p>
                        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                            <img src="../static/img/household.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Recycling household objects">
                        </div>
                    <h2 class="mt-4">Frequently overlooked household objects that are recyclable</h2>
                    <p>It's also reasonable to argue that some household goods are more frequently disposed of in the
                        trash than recycled, leading these issues will help your home become more materials overall.
                        Among them are:</p>
                    <li>Even though foil is easily recycled by washing off food residue and rolling it into a ball for
                        the appropriate container, 59% of Americans still dispose of foil and foil trays in the regular
                        trash. Recall that recycling is easier with larger balls.</li>
                    <li>Clear plastic trays: although our local municipality takes them for recycling, 14% of us throw
                        clear plastic trays--from fruit punnets to mushroom and sausage trays--in the trash. They just
                        need a short rinse to get rid of food residue, so forget about that general garbage and get them
                        ready for recycling!</li>
                    <li>Clear plastic trays: although our local municipality takes them for recycling, 14% of us throw
                        clear plastic trays—from fruit punnets to mushroom and sausage trays—in the trash. They just

                        ready for recycling!</li>
                    <li>Yogurt pots and butter tubs are examples of plastic pots and tubs that should be recycled, but
                        10% of us throw them in the trash instead. Make sure yours are clean and empty before recycling
                        them; you can keep the lids and labels on, but make sure to take off any absorbent pads and
                        plastic film and place them in the general garbage bin.</li>
                    <li>Avoid being one of the 11% and 12% of Pakistani homes that dispose of their empty bottles of
                        cleaning products and toiletries in the trash rather than recycling them! Just give them a quick
                        rinse, crush them, and place them in the recycling while still wearing their lids. Even spray
                        bottles with triggers and sprays remaining can be recycled; however, bottles with pump
                        dispensers (like hand wash bottles) need to have their lids removed.</li>
